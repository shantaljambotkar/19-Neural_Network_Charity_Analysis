# 19-Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The Alphabet Soup’s business team, has a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

1. EIN and NAME—Identification columns
2. APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
3. AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
4. CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
5. USE_CASE—Use case for funding
6. ORGANIZATION—Organization type
7. STATUS—Active status
8. INCOME_AMT—Income classification
9. SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
10. ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
11. IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Following are the deliveables required:

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

## Data Preprocessing

### Variable(s) that are considered the target(s) for the model

### Variable(s) that are considered to be the features for the  model

### Variable(s) that are considered neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### Number of neurons, layers, and activation functions that were selected for the neural network model, and why?

### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

### Model Performance Optimization?

## Summary

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
